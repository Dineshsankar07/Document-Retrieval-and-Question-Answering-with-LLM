# Document-Retrieval-and-Question-Answering-with-LLM
 With Large Language Models, we can integrate domain-specific data to answer questions. Itâ€™s  useful if we are not looking for a specific answer but rather want to explore and understand the context around our  query.
Approach: Through a step-by-step process involving data preprocessing, document embeddings, vector database 
storage, and LLM based query transformation, we can obtain precise and contextually relevant answers from the 
documents.
Outcome: It can be used for a wide range of use cases. It reduces the time needed to interact with the documents. 
The LLM precisely finds the most relevant documents and using them to generate the answer right from our 
documents
